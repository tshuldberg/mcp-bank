# mcp-bank

A suite of infrastructure primitives for the agent-to-agent economy.

MCP-native. x402-paid. No signup. No UI. Machine serves machine.

---

## Thesis

Millions of specialized agents will offer micro-services to each other. The agent that stores memory. The agent that converts formats. The agent that runs code in a sandbox. Each is simple, fast, and cheap. The money is in volume.

We're building the banking layer — the foundational infrastructure primitives every agent needs constantly.

## Products

### 1. Memory Store (active)

Hosted, persistent, cross-session, cross-agent memory with semantic search.

The local MCP memory server gets 67k downloads/week. There is no cloud version. We're building it.

- KV storage: `$0.0001/read`, `$0.001/write`
- Vector search: `$0.01/query`
- First 1,000 reads free per wallet
- MCP + OpenAPI + Google A2A discovery

→ [memory-store/](./memory-store/)

### 2. Transform Agent (active)

Stateless data format conversion: 43+ format pairs. JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, TOML, HTML, Markdown, PDF, Excel, DOCX, and more. Schema validation, inference, diff, merge, filter.

- Text transforms: `$0.001`
- Document transforms: `$0.005`
- Validation/schema: `$0.0005`

→ [transform-agent/](./transform-agent/)

### 3. Code Executor (planned)

Sandboxed Python/JS/Bash execution. Agents generate code constantly and need a safe place to run it. E2B charges $0.10+/hr and requires signup. We charge `$0.001/10-second slot` with x402 and no account.

→ [code-executor/](./code-executor/)

## Discovery

All services are listed on:
- [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/)
- [mcp.so](https://mcp.so/)
- Anthropic's remote MCP server directory

All expose:
- MCP (Streamable HTTP) at `/mcp`
- Google A2A agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
- OpenAPI spec at `/openapi.json`

---

## Payment

All services use [x402](https://www.x402.org/) — the HTTP-native micropayment protocol built on USDC/Base.

```
Agent sends request
  → Server returns HTTP 402 with payment requirements
  → Agent wallet signs and sends USDC
  → Server verifies on-chain
  → Service rendered
  → USDC lands in wallet
```

No Stripe. No invoices. No forms. Machine pays machine.
